    <h1><center>THE COMEDY OF ERRORS</center></h1>
    <h2><center>written by <font color="red">WILLIAM SHAKESPEAR</font></center></h2>
    <h4 style="text-align:center"><em><u>my one of the favourite story</u></em></h4>

    <h3><center>
        <p>The Comedy of Errors is one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s early plays. 
           It is his shortest and 
           one of his most farcical comedies, with a major part of the humour coming from slapstick and mistaken 
           identity, in addition to puns and word play. The Comedy of Errors is, along with The Tempest, one of only two 
           Shakespearean plays to observe the Aristotelian principle of unity of time—that is, that the events of a 
           play should occur over 24 hours. It has been adapted for opera, stage, screen and musical 
           theatre numerous times worldwide. In the centuries following its premiere, the play's title has entered the 
           popular English lexicon as an idiom for "an event or series of 
           events made ridiculous by the number of errors that were made throughout".
        </p>

        <p>
           Set in the Greek city of Ephesus, The Comedy of Errors tells the story of two sets of identical twins 
           who were accidentally separated at birth. Antipholus of Syracuse and his servant, Dromio of Syracuse, 
           arrive in Ephesus, which turns out to be the home of their twin brothers, Antipholus of Ephesus and his 
           servant, Dromio of Ephesus. When the Syracusans encounter the friends and families of their twins, a series 
           of wild mishaps based on mistaken identities lead to wrongful beatings, a near-seduction, the arrest of 
           Antipholus of Ephesus, and false accusations of 
           infidelity, theft, madness, and demonic possession.

    <h2><u>SUMMARY</u> : </h2>
    <h3>
    <p>
        Egeon, a merchant of Syracuse, is condemned to death in Ephesus for violating the ban 
        against travel between the two rival cities. As he is led to his execution, he tells the Ephesian Duke, 
        Solinus, that he has come to Syracuse in search of his wife and one of his twin sons, who were separated 
        from him 25 years ago in a shipwreck. The other twin, who grew up with Egeon, is also traveling the world in 
        search of the missing half of their family. (The twins, we learn, are identical, and each has an identical 
        twin slave named Dromio.) The Duke is so moved by this story that he grants Egeon a day 
        to raise the thousand-mark ransom that would be necessary to save his life.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, unknown to Egeon, his son Antipholus of Syracuse (and Antipholus' slave Dromio) is also visiting 
        Ephesus--where Antipholus' missing twin, known as Antipholus of Ephesus, is a prosperous citizen of the city. 
        Adriana, Antipholus of Ephesus' wife, mistakes Antipholus of Syracuse for her husband and drags him home for dinner, 
        leaving Dromio of Syracuse to stand guard at the door and admit no one. Shortly thereafter, Antipholus of Ephesus 
        (with his slave Dromio of Ephesus) returns home and is refused entry to his own house. Meanwhile, Antipholus of 
        Syracuse has fallen in love with Luciana, Adriana's sister, who is appalled at the behavior of the man she thinks 
        is her brother-in-law.

    <h2><u>SYNOPSIS</u> :</h2>
    <ul>
        <!--using strong tag-->
        <li><strong>ACT I</strong>
            <p>Because a law forbids merchants from Syracuse to enter Ephesus, elderly Syracusian 
            trader Egeon faces execution when he is discovered in the city. He can only escape by paying a fine of a thousand marks. 
            He tells his sad story to Solinus, Duke of Ephesus. In his youth, Egeon married and had twin sons. On the same day, 
            a poor woman without a job also gave birth to twin boys, and he purchased these as slaves to his sons. 
            Soon afterward, the family made a sea voyage and was hit by a tempest. Egeon lashed himself to the main-mast
            with one son and one slave, and his wife took the other two infants. His wife was rescued by one boat, 
            Egeon by another. Egeon never again saw his wife or the children with her. Recently his son Antipholus, now grown, 
            and his son's slave Dromio left Syracuse to find their brothers. When Antipholus did not return, Egeon set out in search of him. 
            The Duke is moved by this story and grants Egeon one day to pay his fine.</p>

            <p>That same day, Antipholus arrives in Ephesus, searching 
            for his brother. He sends Dromio to deposit some money at The Centaur, an inn. 
            He is confounded when the identical Dromio of Ephesus appears almost immediately, denying any knowledge of the 
            money and asking him home to dinner, where his wife is waiting. Antipholus, thinking his servant is making 
            insubordinate jokes, beats Dromio of Ephesus.</p>
            <center>

            </center>
        </li>

        <li><strong>ACT II</strong>
            <p> Dromio of Ephesus returns to his mistress, Adriana, saying that her "husband" refused to come back to his house, 
                and even pretended not to know her. Adriana, concerned that her husband's eye is straying, 
                takes this news as confirmation of her suspicions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Antipholus of Syracuse, who complains "I could not speak with Dromio since at first, 
                I sent him from the mart," meets up with Dromio of Syracuse who now denies making a "joke" about Antipholus having a wife. 
                Antipholus begins beating him. Suddenly, Adriana rushes up to Antipholus of Syracuse and begs him not to leave her. 
                The Syracusans cannot but attribute these strange events to witchcraft, remarking that Ephesus is known as a warren for witches. 
                Antipholus and Dromio go off with this strange woman, the one to eat dinner and the other to keep the gate.

        </li>

        <li><strong>ACT III</strong>
            <p>
                Antipholus of Ephesus returns home for dinner and is enraged to find that he is rudely refused entry to his own 
                house by Dromio of Syracuse, who is keeping the gate. He is ready to break down the door, 
                but his friends persuade him not to make a scene. He decides, instead, to dine with a courtesan. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside the house, Antipholus of Syracuse discovers that he is very attracted to his "wife's" sister, Luciana of Smyrna, 
                telling her "train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note / To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears." 
                She is flattered by his attention but worried about their moral implications. After she exits, Dromio of Syracuse announces 
                that he has discovered that he has a wife: Nell, a hideous kitchen-maid. He describes her as "spherical, like a globe; 
                I could find out countries in her". Antipholus jokingly asks him to identify the countries, leading to a witty exchange in 
                which parts of her body are identified with nations. Ireland is her buttocks: "I found it out by the bogs". He claims 
                he has discovered America and the Indies "upon her nose all o'er embellished with rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining 
                their rich aspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent whole armadas of cracks to be ballast at her nose." The Syracusans 
                decide to leave as soon as possible, and Dromio runs off to make travel plans. Antipholus of Syracuse is then confronted by 
                Angelo of Ephesus, a goldsmith, who claims that Antipholus ordered a chain from him. 
                Antipholus is forced to accept the chain, and Angelo says that he will return for payment.

            </center>
        </li>

        <li><strong>ACT IV</strong>
            <p>
                Antipholus of Ephesus dispatches Dromio of Ephesus to purchase a rope so that he can beat his wife 
                Adriana for locking him out, then is accosted by Angelo, who tells him "I thought to have ta'en you at the 
                Porpentine" and asks to be reimbursed for the chain. He denies ever seeing it and is promptly arrested. 
                As he is being led away, Dromio of Syracuse arrives, whereupon Antipholus dispatches him back to Adriana's 
                house to get money for his bail. After completing this errand, Dromio of Syracuse mistakenly delivers the money 
                to Antipholus of Syracuse. The Courtesan spies Antipholus wearing the gold chain, 
                and says he promised it to her in exchange for her ring. The Syracusans deny this and flee.

        <li><strong>ACT V</strong>
            <p>
                The Courtesan resolves to tell Adriana that her husband is insane. Dromio of Ephesus returns to the arrested 
                Antipholus of Ephesus, with the rope. Antipholus is infuriated. Adriana, Luciana, and the Courtesan enter with a 
                conjurer named Pinch, who tries to exorcize the Ephesians, who are bound and taken to Adriana's house. 
                The Syracusans enter, carrying swords, and everybody runs off for fear: believing that they are the Ephesians, 
                out for vengeance after somehow escaping their bonds. Adriana reappears with henchmen, who attempt to bind the Syracusans. 
                They take sanctuary in a nearby priory, where the Abbess resolutely protects them. Suddenly, the Abbess enters 
                with the Syracusan twins, and everyone begins to understand the confused events of the day. Not only are the two sets
                of twins reunited, but the Abbess reveals that she is Egeon's wife, Emilia of Babylon. The Duke pardons Egeon. 
                All exit into the abbey to celebrate the reunification of the family.

    <h3>
        <p>The film Big Business (1988) is a modern take on A Comedy of Errors, with female twins instead of male. 
            Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin star in the film as two sets of twins separated at birth, much like the 
            characters in Shakespeare's play.</p>

            <p>Indian cinema has made eight films based on the play:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Dooni_Char">Do Dooni Char</a> starring Kishore Kumar</li>

                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhranti_Bilas">Bhrantibilas</a> (1963 Bengali film) starring Uttam Kumar</li>
                <li>A movie in the Kannada language titled Ulta Palta starring Ramesh Aravind</li>
                <li>A movie in the Telugu language titled Ulta Palta starring Rajendra Prasad</li>

                <li>Local Kung Fu 2 (2017 Assamese martial arts film).</li>
            </ul>
        <p>In 1940 the film The Boys from Syracuse was released, starring Alan Jones and Joe Penner as Antipholus and Dromio. 
            It was a musical, loosely based on "Comedy of Errors".</p>
